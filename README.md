# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I built the Prework Study Guide webpage as an organizational tool for my notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript as preparation for coding bootcamp. The motivation behind this project was to create a central place to reference key concepts about coding and track my progress while learning about these tools. It solves the problem of having scattered notes across different places by providing a simple webpage where all my notes are in one spot. Through this project, I learned how to structure a basic webpage, work with HTML and CSS, and use JavaScript to make the page interactive.

The Prework Study Guide is designed to help organize and review key topics from coding bootcamp, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Each section contains brief notes on these topics, offering a quick reference for important concepts. By opening the DevTools console in the browser, you can see the JavaScript in action. It will log the topics we've covered in prework and randomly select one for us to study first. This interactive feature helps prioritize learning by guiding us to focus on a specific topic.
